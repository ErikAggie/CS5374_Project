This project is being developed in IntelliJ Community 2017.2. To run this project:
1. In IntelliJ's opening screen, select "Check out from Version Control. Choose GitHub as the source, and use this as the Git Repository URL: https://github.com/ErikAggie/CS5374_Project.git
2. Build the project.
3. Create a Junit test configuration, testing all Junits found in package edu.ttu.erikpeterson.cs5381.test.
4. Run the Junits

This is my semester project for CS5381 (Verification and Validation) at Texas Tech University. It scans Java source files to uncover potential deadlocks.

See the wiki for more about my plans for the project.
